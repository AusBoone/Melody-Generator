# Melody Generator CI
# This workflow performs linting and unit tests using multiple versions of
# Python. A previous "test.yml" workflow duplicated this behavior. Both have now
# been consolidated here to reduce redundancy and simplify maintenance.
#
# Steps:
#   1. Checkout repository source.
#   2. Install Python for each matrix entry.
#   3. Install project and test dependencies.
#   4. Run Ruff for style checks.
#   5. Execute pytest for the test suite.

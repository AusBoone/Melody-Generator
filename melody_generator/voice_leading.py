"""Utilities for detecting basic counterpoint issues.

This module contains helpers used by the melody generator to discourage
problematic motion such as parallel fifths or octaves.  The primary
functions are ``counterpoint_penalty`` and ``parallel_fifths_mask`` which
return weighting adjustments and boolean masks respectively.  All inputs are
provided as note names (e.g. ``"C4"``) so the routines remain agnostic to the
rest of the system.

Example
-------
>>> counterpoint_penalty("C4", "D4", prev_dir=1, prev_interval=7)
0.2

Design Notes
------------
- ``numpy`` is used for vectorized computation when available but the code
  falls back to pure Python for simplicity and testability.
- Only minimal music theory is encodedâ€”these checks are meant as gentle
  nudges rather than strict rules.
